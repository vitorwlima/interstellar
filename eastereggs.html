        <h2 class="subtitle-1">The Dust Bowl interviews</h2>
        <p>The interviews at the beginning of Interstellar are from actual people. The footage was taken from Ken Burn’s 2012 PBS film The Dust Bowl adding even more authenticity to the entire ordeal. The doc features 26 survivors’ accounts of the actual Dust Bowl event and looks at humanity’s effects on the world. Ellen Burstyn, who plays older Murph, which the audience doesn’t learn until the end, is the only one that is not part of the PBS documentary.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Real corn, real profits</h2>
        <p>There is a lot of corn in Interstellar, with most people thinking that the film that won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects made all those kernels on a computer screen. They’d be wrong. All the corn seen in the movie is real. Christopher Nolan had 500 acres of corn grown for the project, and then sold after the film wrapped for a profit. The iconic filmmaker is always innovating the cinema game in so many ways.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">The Event Horizon pencil trick</h2>
        <p>In Interstellar, Romilly explains to Coop how a wormhole works by folding a piece of paper and jamming a writing utensil through a certain point. This is not the first time this method has been used on the big screen. The 1997 cult classic Event Horizon stars Jurassic Park’s Sam Neill, who uses the exact same demonstration to convey to the crew how the space phenomenon works. On the small screen, Scott Clarke does the same thing with a paper plate during an episode of Netflix’s hit series Stranger Things, making this the best way to get the wormhole point across.</p>
